== Prerequisites

=== Environment

|===
| Node | 0.10.21
|===

=== Notify Development Team

The person performing a release should post a message to the #richwidgets channel on irc.freenode.net.

=== Review Issue Tracker Status and Continuous Integration

Before starting any release steps, make sure the continuous integration builds pass and that all issues scheduled to particular version are resolved.

Issue Tracker:

* https://github.com/richwidgets/richwidgets/issues?state=open[RichWidgets issue tracker on GitHub]
** select appropriate milestone

Continous Integration builds:

* https://travis-ci.org/richwidgets/richwidgets[Travis CI - master branch continuous integration]
** need to pass at 100%
* https://richfaces.ci.cloudbees.com/job/richwidgets-browser-matrix/[CloudBees/SauceLabs - browser compatibility matrix]
** these jobs should pass on all supported browsers at 100% during candidate releases
** they does not have to fully pass during alpha releases

=== Finish Release Notes

`release-notes.md` should be updated before starting with a release.

== Release Staging

1. Make sure all respected commits are committed in `master` branch.
1. Diverge a branch `stage` from the latest commit on `master` branch (this is a branch used for release testing)
1. Change version of the project in `bower.json` and `package.json` to release version (drop `-wip` suffix)
1. Build a distribution in `dist/` directory and add it to the repository using `git add -f dist/`
1. Push the `stage` branch upstream, making it available for release verification

== Release testing

At this point the release is prepared for testing by QE team.

What needs to be verified:

* all tests pass on all supported browsers

== Creating and Pushing Tag

Once the release pass QE criteria:

1. Create a tag from latest commit on a `stage` branch, call the tag by a release version: e.g. `0.2`
1. Push the tag to upstream repository
1. Remove `dist/` branch
1. Change version of the project in `bower.json` and `package.json` to development version (drop `-wip` suffix)
1. Merge `stage` branch (that includes the tag) to `master` branch (so that it appears in `master` branch history)
1. Drop a `stage` branch

== Releasing

1. Create a Release in GitHub interface
1. Attach a built ZIP distribution (snapshot of tag sources that include built `dist/`)

== Release verification

* the ZIP can be downloaded from GitHub Releases view
* the tag can be downloaded via Bower
